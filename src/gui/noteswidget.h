/**
 * @brief Editable rich-text notes
 *
 * Widget in flexible GUI of BeamerPresenter which represents rich text
 * which can be edited, loaded, and saved (as HTML).
 *
 * File structure of the saved xml files: xml tree with root element
 * "speakernotes" containing elements "page". Each "page" element has
 * an attribute "label" representing the page label (a string) and
 * contains HTML text.
 *
 * Keyboard shortcuts for the page label are hard-coded:
 * Ctrl+S for saving, Ctrl+Shift+S for saving under a different file
 * name and Ctrl+O for loading a different file.
