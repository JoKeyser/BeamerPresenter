### LAYOUT

## Colors
# These are the default values. You don't need to set any values.
# Possible values for colors are the colors specified by Qt or RGB or ARGB values
# in hexadecimal form #RRGGBB or #AARRGGBB.
presentation color=black
notes background color=gray
notes text color=black

# Color transition for timer
# Define colors of the timer for times (in seconds) relative to the timeout.

# white 5 minutes before the timeout:
timer/-300 = #ffffff
# blue 2:30 min before the timeout:
timer/-150 = #0080ff
# green at the timout:
timer/   0 = #00ff00
# yellow 2:30 min after the timeout:
timer/ 150 = #ffff00
# red 5 min after the timeout:
timer/ 300 = #ff0000
# violet 10 min after the timeout:
timer/ 600 = #e00080

# Minimum number of frames shown between each timer step for a smooth transition.
# (The actual frame rate can be higher. The time between two frames is at least 40ms.)
color-frames = 25

## Geometry
# Set the minimum width of the sidebar on the control screen (relative to the window width).
# Default value: 20% of the window width.
