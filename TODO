Simple fixes and features:
* (target 0.1.2) mark eraser with circle
* (target 0.1.3) handle reoccuring page labels
* (target 0.1.3) use thumbnails in overview box
* fill drawings as in xournalpp: fill QRect and draw boundary clipping out this QRect
* remove support for legacy file format
* remove submenu patch for wayland

Medium workload:
* better eraser (insert intermediate nodes?)
* (target 0.1.4) undo erasing in draw mode
* (target 0.1.4) (optionally) show preview of next slide without overlays
* (target 0.1.3) allow non-uniform page sizes
* (target 0.1.4) flexibly change draw tools: color and size from text input fields or sliders?
* Use gzip (optionally) and read/write compressed Xournal(++) files directly
* (target 0.1.3) generate overview in own thread
* (target 0.1.2) media slide: remove unnecessary properties: lists of video positions, ...

Longer rewrite:
* (target 0.1.2) use one global graphics view including page widget + video overlays + draw overlay + slide transitions
* (target 0.1.2) use OpenGL again (at least for slide transitions)?
* (target 0.1.2) drawing in slide transitions: restructure
* (target 0.1.3) restructure rendering, especially DrawOverlay paint events (and draw cache)
* (target 0.1.?) new draw tool: add text
* (target 0.1.5) video widgets: use one global graphics scene, connect two views to it, combine with slide transitions
* support stylus input devices (QTabletEvent: position and pressure) and tablet gestures (for navigation)
* separate "extra features" (like drawing and multimedia) from basic features (fast navigation, cache)

Multimedia:
* hide video widgets if they reached end of file
* key bindings for multimedia control
* allow more arguments
* better control bar

General:
* mv src/icons share/icons (after rewriting)
* document code!
* search for memory leaks
* check (and reduce) memory usage
* test in ubuntu
* Rewrite? The old code has many problems...

Low priority:
* better icon (and png icons)
* Make timer editable
* Search document
* Embedded multimedia, RichMediaAnnotations
* Implement other link types (history, search)
* Implement optional content (e.g. for sound)
