BeamerPresenter

* drawing in slide transitions: restructure
* Video widgets: use one global graphics scene, connect two views to it, combine with slide transitions

* Synchronize video widgets (broken since rewriting video widgets)
* Test in ubuntu

* Use OpenGL again (at least for slide transitions)?
* Start rendering enlarged page first for presentation, then for notes draw slide
* Document code!
* Check (and reduce) memory usage
* Key bindings for multimedia control
* Multimedia: allow more arguments
* Multimedia: Better control bar
* Video widgets break when switching between notes and draw mode?

* better icon (and png icons)
* use thumbnails in overviewbox?
* Undo erasing in draw mode?
* Segfault when starting embedded application from the wrong screen (not reproducible?)
* Bug report for Qt5.13 in wayland: paintEvent not drawn immediately
* less overloading

* Make timer editable
* Embedded multimedia, RichMediaAnnotations
* Cache management: test, clean up the code, improve
* Search document
* Implement other link types (history, search)
* Implement optional content (e.g. for sound)
