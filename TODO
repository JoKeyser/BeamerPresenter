BeamerPresenter

* cache management can crash, disabling cache completely (occurred after reloading files): not simply reproducible
* Segfault when embedded application appears during slide change?
* Draw in presentation:
	*	show annotations in magnifier
	*	show annotations on top of video content
	*	improve annotations in slide transitions
	*	sync multimedia content

* Make timer editable
* Multimedia sliders: key bindings and signals slider <-> player
* TOC: key bindings

* Cache management: test, clean up the code, improve
* Embedded applications: Terminate processes correctly before closing the window
* Embedded applications: debug, test, use wildecards
* Handle focus of embedded windows

* Multimedia: allow more arguments
* Multimedia: Better control bar
* Embedded sounds

* Search document
* Support locked and encrypted pdfs: Enter passwords in QDialog? hide password input!
* Implement other link types (history, search)
* Implement optional content (e.g. for sound)
* Make poppler rendering to cache more efficient (use multiple threads)

* Avoid short black flash when showing video or page transition
* use OpenGL again?
