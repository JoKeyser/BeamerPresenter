BeamerPresenter

* Embed external applications:
	QProcess and QWidget::createWindowContainer (-> need to know window ID, platform dependent!)
	-> optionally interpret url of execution link as name + arguments (-> option "embed") separated by character (e.g. "&", set in options and config)
	-> or provide list of files (with wildcard characters) -> also set in options and config
	-> need to know window ID: Find solution for X11 or use stdout of executed program
	-> examples with matplotlib, pyqtgraph and video player

* Better video and sound control bar
* Improve sound (check whether it should be run in a loop, support embedded files)
* Improve videos (palindrome mode, make autostart optional)

* Improve layout
* Improve cache
* Search document
* Support locked and encrypted pdfs: Enter passwords in QDialog? hide password input!
* Implement other link types (history, search)
* Implement optional content (e.g. for sound)
