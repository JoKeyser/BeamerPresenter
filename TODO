* drawing in slide transitions: restructure
* Avoid that video widget graps focus and handles keyboard input (previous/next keys)
* Synchronize video widgets (broken since rewriting video widgets)
* Test in ubuntu
* Start rendering enlarged page first for presentation, then for notes draw slide
* Document code!
* Check (and reduce) memory usage
* Key bindings for multimedia control
* Multimedia: allow more arguments
* Multimedia: Better control bar

* use thumbnails in overviewbox?
* Undo erasing in draw mode?
* Segfault when starting embedded application from the wrong screen (not reproducible?)
* Bug report for Qt5.13 in wayland: paintEvent not drawn immediately
* Check how icons should be handled
* less overloading

* Video widgets break when switching between notes and draw mode
* cache management can crash, disabling cache completely (occurred after reloading files): not simply reproducible
* Draw in presentation:
	* show annotations on top of video content
	* sync multimedia content
	* use OpenGL again?

* Make timer editable
* Embedded multimedia, RichMediaAnnotations
* Cache management: test, clean up the code, improve

* Search document
* Implement other link types (history, search)
* Implement optional content (e.g. for sound)
* Make poppler rendering to cache more efficient (use multiple threads)
* Set times per slide for non-integer page labels
