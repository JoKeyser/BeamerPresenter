Relatively simple fixes:
* set times per slide for non-integer page labels

Longer rewrite:
* restructure rendering, especially DrawOverlay paint events (and draw cache)
* allow non-uniform page sizes
* drawing in slide transitions: restructure
* use OpenGL again (at least for slide transitions)?

Draw tools:
* flexibly change draw tools: color and size from text input fields or sliders?
* new draw tool: add text
* undo erasing in draw mode

Multimedia:
* hide video widgets if they reached end of file
* video widgets: use one global graphics scene, connect two views to it, combine with slide transitions
* key bindings for multimedia control
* allow more arguments
* better control bar

General:
* document code!
* search for memory leaks
* check (and reduce) memory usage
* test in ubuntu

Low priority:
* better icon (and png icons)
* generate overview in own thread
* use thumbnails in overviewbox?
* Make timer editable
* Search document
* Embedded multimedia, RichMediaAnnotations
* Implement other link types (history, search)
* Implement optional content (e.g. for sound)
