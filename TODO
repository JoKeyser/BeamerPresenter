Simple fixes and features:
* (target 0.1.2) handle reoccuring page labels
* (target 0.1.2) undo erasing in draw mode
* (target 0.1.3) use thumbnails in overviewbox

Medium workload:
* (target 0.1.3) (optionally) show preview of next slide without overlays
* (target 0.1.3) allow non-uniform page sizes
* (target 0.1.?) flexibly change draw tools: color and size from text input fields or sliders?
* Use gzip (optionally) and read/write compressed Xournal(++) files directly
* (target 0.1.3) generate overview in own thread

Longer rewrite:
* (target 0.1.2) restructure rendering, especially DrawOverlay paint events (and draw cache)
* (target 0.1.4) use OpenGL again (at least for slide transitions)?
* (target 0.1.5) drawing in slide transitions: restructure
* (target 0.1.?) new draw tool: add text
* (target 0.1.5) video widgets: use one global graphics scene, connect two views to it, combine with slide transitions

Multimedia:
* hide video widgets if they reached end of file
* key bindings for multimedia control
* allow more arguments
* better control bar

General:
* document code!
* search for memory leaks
* check (and reduce) memory usage
* test in ubuntu

Low priority:
* better icon (and png icons)
* Make timer editable
* Search document
* Embedded multimedia, RichMediaAnnotations
* Implement other link types (history, search)
