.SH NAME
beamerpresenter-ui \- user interface of BeamerPresenter
.
.SH GENERAL
.
The GUI configuration file is JSON-formatted, containing a list of widgets, each of which defines an own window. Each widget is a JSON dictionary. There are widgets providing their own content and layout widgets which do not provide own contents, but contain a list of child widgets. This allows you to define a layout tree.
.PP
Example configuration files can be found in /usr/share/doc/beamerpresenter/examples/.
.PP
Arguments shared by all widgets:
.TP
.BI "type" " name"
widget type defined in section WIDGETS. This is the only mandatory argument.
.TP
.BI "keys " "keyboard shortcut"
Key combination to set focus to this widget. Example: use \[dq]keys\[dq]:\[dq]Ctrl+F\[dq] for a search widget.
.TP
.BI "title " "text"
title of the widget, visible only if the widget is shown in a tabbed widget.
.TP
.BI "color " "color name / #RRGGBB / #AARRGGBB"
background color, color name known to Qt. Some Qt styles may override colors set in the GUI config.
.PP
Arguments for all top level widgets (widgets that are shown as windows):
.TP
.BI "always show " bool
This window should always be shown on top of other windows if the window manager supports that. Default value is false except if the widget is of type \[dq]tool selector\[dq].

.B notes
rich text editable notes.
Notes are included when saving drawings to gzipped xml file (.bpr/.xopp).
Alternatively, they can be saved separately in an xml file using the keyboard actions while the notes widget has focus:
save notes with Ctrl+S, save under new file name with Ctrl+Shift+S, open from file with Ctrl+O.
Currently the notes are saved as HTML string, which is escaped when saving in xml format. This format might change in the future!

.TP
.BI "file " "path"

If multiple widgets show the same slide, the configuration of one of these widgets is used for the other widgets. Switching off multimedia for one widget may also disable multimedia for other widgets.
.TP
.BI "mute " "= true"
mute or unmute the slide connected to this widget.
By default normal slides are muted and slides marked as \[dq]master\[dq] are unmuted.
Make sure that exactly one slide widget is unmuted in the GUI configuration (typically the presentation slide widget).
.TP
.BI "transitions " "= true"
enable/disable slide transitions.

.TP
.BI "cache hash " "integer"
integer to identify slide widgets with the same geometry, which should use the same cached slides. Set the same \[dq]cache hash\[dq] for multiple slides to make them use the same cache. Note that this can also cause problems if the geometry of the widgets is not exactly the same.

number of threads used to pre-render pages in cache. Disable pre-rendering by setting this to zero.
.TP
.BI "overlays " "first/last/none"
show only first/last page of each group of pages with the same page label.
.TP
.BI "scroll mode aspect " "number"
experimental: set width / height ratio of scroll view widget. Scroll view means that the page size is not completely fit to the window size. Instead, pages will be shown with fixed width and you probably want to scroll down. See also: actions \[dq]scroll down\[dq] and similar.

Both the total time and the passed time are editable text fields. By double-clicking between these two text fields you can store the passed time (left field) as the target time for the currently visible page. These times per page are stored when saving drawings. The times per page are used to indicate the current progress relative to the planned progress by the background color of the passed time text field.
.PP
.RS
Arguments:
.TP
.BI "require confirmation " "bool"
Ask for confirmation before setting the time for a slide.

When asking for confirmation when setting the time for a slide, this will be the default (accept or cancel). The default value is false.
.TP
.BI colormap " JSON object"
Customize the function mapping the current time relative to the target time of the current slide to a color. This JSON object maps times (as integers, in seconds) to colors (e.g. in #rrggbb format). Positive times indicate that the speaker has this amount of time left. Between the times defined in this map, a linear interpolation is used.

Default configuration:
.nf
.eo
"colormap" : {
    "-300" : "#ff0000",
