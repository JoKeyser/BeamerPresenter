.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.B BeamerPresenter
is a Qt5-based presentation viewer which shows a presentation and notes for the speaker in two different windows. It is designed primarily for usage with LaTeX-beamer generated presentations and notes. Slides and notes must be PDF documents.
.PP
Along with the notes,
.B BeamerPresenter
shows images of the current and next slide and a timer.
.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.TP
.B \-h \-\-help
Displays this help.
.
.TP
.BI "\-a \-\-autoplay " delay
true, false or number: Start video and audio content when entering a slide. A number is interpreted as a delay in seconds, after which multimedia content is started.
.
.TP
.BI "\-A \-\-autoplay-emb " delay
true, false or number: Start embedded applications when entering a slide. A number is interpreted as a delay in seconds, after which embedded applications are started.
Not available if embedded applications were disabled at compile time.
.
.TP
.BI "\-\-mute-notes" bool
Mute or unmute all content on control screen.
.
.TP
.BI "\-\-mute-presentation" bool
Mute or unmute all content on presentation screen.
.
.TP
.BI "\-b \-\-blinds " integer
Set number of blinds in blinds slide transition.
.
.TP
.BI "\-c \-\-cache " integer
Set the maximum number of slides, which are rendered to images and stored in a compressed cache. A negative number is treated as infinity.
.
.TP
.BI "\-d \-\-no-transitions "
Disable all slide transition.
.
.TP
.BI "\-e \-\-embed " files
Mark these files for embedding if an execution link points to them. Multiple files should be separated only by a comma (not space!).
Not available if embedded applications were disabled at compile time.
.
.TP
.BI "\-g \-\-glitter-pixel " integer
Set size (length) of glitter pixel in glitter slide transition. The default value is 30.
.
.TP
.BI "\-G \-\-glitter-steps " integer
Set number of independent glitter pixels in glitter slide transition. This number times the glitter pixel size divided by the screen width should not be approximately an integer or a fraction like 1/2, 1/3, 3/2, ...
Best results are obtained for prime numbers of order 1000 (depending on pixel size and the screen resolution). Larger numbers lead to more randomness, but require more computational power. The default value is 167.
.
.TP
.BI "\-j \-\-json " file
Select a local configuration file. The file must be in JSON format and can contain the same configuration as the global configuration file. Additionally, it can contain a map of slides to times, at which you want to finish the slide. These times are used to adjust the color of the timer.
.
.TP
.BI "\-l \-\-toc-depth " integer
.RB "Number of levels in the table of contents, which will be shown on the control screen with shortcut " t ". Possible values range from 1 and 4. An additional level will be shown as a pop-up menu if necessary."
.
.TP
.BI "\-m \-\-min-delay " delay
Set minimum time per frame in milliseconds. This is useful when using \\animation in LaTeX beamer.
.
.TP
.BI "\-M \-\-memory " integer
Set the maximum cache size in MiB. A negative number is treated as infinity. The real memory usage can be slightly larger than this limit, because slides are rendered to cache without any knowledge about their size in memory beforehand.
.
.TP
.B \-n \-\-no-notes
Show only the presentation window and no notes. This will only hide the notes window and does not improve the performance.
.
.TP
.BI "\-o \-\-columns " integer
Set the number of columns of slides, which will be shown in the overview mode on the control screen.
.
.TP
.BI "\-p \-\-page-part " side
Set half of the page to be the presentation, the other half to be the notes. Values are "l" or "r" for presentation on the left or right half of the page, respectively. If the presentation was created with "\\setbeameroption{show notes on second screen=right}", you should use
.B \-\-page-part 
.IR right .
.
.TP
.BI "\-r \-\-renderer " command
Command for calling an external PDF renderer, which will be used for rendering slides to a compressed cache.
This should be either "poppler" (for using the internal renderer), "custom" (for using a renderer, which is defined in the config file) or a command.
The command should call a renderer, which renders a specific page of a PDF file to a png image of fixed size, such that it can be shown in a window with given width and height and writes the image to the standard output.
The command should contain the tokens "%file" for the PDF file name, "%page" for the page number, "%width" for the image width in pixels and "%height" for the height in pixels.
Note that a failing command will not necessarily be handled correctly or lead to a warning.

An example for a command using
.BR "mutool draw " "from the " MuPDF " project is"
.RB \[dq] "mutool draw"
.IR -F "png " -w "%width " -h "%height " -o "- %file %page\[dq]."
.
.TP
.BI "\-s \-\-scrollstep " integer
Touch pads quantify scroll events as numbers of pixels. This option sets the number of pixels, which are interpreted as the step between two pages. A larger number makes the scrolling slower.
.
.TP
.BI "\-t \-\-timer " time
.RI "Set timer to " "time" ". Possible formats are ""[m]m"", ""[m]m:ss"" and ""h:mm:ss""."
.
.TP
.BI "\-u \-\-urlsplit " character
Use this character (it may also be a sequence) to split links into a link path and a list of arguments. Using PDFs with such links can be convenient, but will make the links work only in this application. This does not follow the PDF standards. Possible arguments are
.BR embed " (for executables), " autoplay " (for videos and sounds) and " loop " (for videos and sounds)."
.
.TP
.BI "\-w \-\-pid2wid " program
Path to a program, which takes a process ID as an argument and returns the window ID of the corresponding window. This can be an executable shell script using
.BR wmctrl (1)
with the command
.B echo
.IR "$(( " "16#" "$("
.BR wmctrl " -lp | " sed " -n
.RI "\[dq]s/^0x\e([0-9a-f]\e+\e) \e+[0-9]\e+ \e+" $1 " .*$/\e1/p\[dq] " ") ))"

Not available if embedded applications were disabled at compile time.
.
.TP
.BI "\-v \-\-video-cache " boolean
If set to true, videos will be loaded to cache when reaching the slide before the one containing the video.
.
.TP
.BI \-\-icon-path " path"
Path used to search for icons, e.g. /usr/share/icons/default.
.
.TP
.B \-\-force-show
.RB "Show the notes window even if showing two windows might cause problems on your platform. If you are using a frame buffer QPA backend, this forces showing a single window (the presentation) although " BeamerPresenter " will probably freeze and your system might be blocked. This option is only available if " BeamerPresenter " was compiled with the option CHECK_QPA_PLATFORM."
.
.TP
.B \-\-force-touchpad
Treat all scrolling signals as touch pads.
.
.TP
.BI \-\-pen-width " integer"
Line width of the pens in pixels.
.
.TP
.BI \-\-highlighter-width " integer"
Line width of the highlighter in pixels.
.
.TP
.BI \-\-eraser-size " integer"
Radius of the eraser in pixels.
.
.TP
.BI \-\-magnifier-size " integer"
Radius of the magnifier in pixels.
.
.TP
.BI \-\-magnification " number"
Magnification factor of the magnifier.
.
.TP
.BI \-\-torch-size " integer"
Radius of the torch in pixels.
.
.TP
.BI \-\-pointer-size " integer"
Radius of the pointer in pixels.
.
.
.SH DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS
.
Key bindings can be changed in the  configuration file. The default configuration is the following.
.TP
.B Mouse wheel

.
.SH FEATURES
.
.SS Links
When clicking on a link on the presentation screen, on the notes slide or on the preview of the current or next slide with the right mouse button,
.B BeamerPresenter
will try to follow the link. Links to multimedia content and embedded applications are disabled for the preview slides.
.
.SS Browse Notes
By changing the current page number in the corresponding text field, the note page and the preview of the current and next slide on the control screen will be updated immediately. The same is true if you scroll with the mouse wheel on the control screen. The presentation screen will be updated only when pressing
.BR return ", " PageUp ", or " PageDown .
You can escape this mode and go back to the current slide on the presentation by pressing
.BR escape .
.
.SS Browse Table of Contents and overview
.RB "You can show a table of contents on the control screen with shortcut " t " for quick navigation. The maximum level of subsections shown in the table of contents can be controlled with the option " \-l " or " \-\-toc-depth ". For entries with more levels, one additional level is shown as a pop-up menu."
.PP
.RB "An overview of all presentation slides is shown on the control screen with the key binding " s ". The number of columns in this overview mode can be controlled with the option " \-o " or " \-\-columns .
.
.SS Overlays
Multimedia content and embedded applications are aware of overlays. If a video is shown on consecutive slides with the same page label, it will continue playing without interruption when switching within these slides. The same works for embedded applications independent of the page label.
.PP
You can jump to the next or previous slide with a different page label by using the arrow keys
.BR Up " and " Down .
For presentations created with LaTeX beamer using overlays, this jumps to the next or previous slide, which differs by more than an overlay.
.
.SS Cache
Slides are rendered to a compressed cache in order to allow for much faster slide changes. The number of cached slides and the memory usage can be limited by the options
.BR cache " and " memory .
By default up to 100 MiB are used for cached slides, which is usually enough even for long presentations.
Restricting the cache size to a small (but nonzero) value can affect the performance and might lead to unstable behavior.
Caching slides can be switched off completely with the command line option
.BR -c 0.
.PP
Rendering to cache can be done using a custom PDF renderer. While
.B BeamerPresenter
is based on the Qt5 bindings of poppler, rendering to cache can be done using any renderer, which can be called from the command line, accepts a filename, page number and page size as arguments and writes a rendered PDF page as PNG image to standard output.
An example of such a PDF renderer, which improves both speed and quality of the output image, is
.BR "mutool draw " "from the " MuPDF " project."
.
.SS Multimedia Support
.B BeamerPresenter
can show videos, which are linked in the PDF as annotation. For each video in the presentation a slider is created and shown in the lower right corner of the control screen. Videos can also be shown in the notes, but there is no synchronization between different videos. All multimedia content can be started immediately when entering a frame by using the option
.BR \-a " or " \-\-autoplay .
.PP
Audio files which are links from the PDF to external files can also be played. Embedded sounds are not supported.
.
.SS Animations
Simple animations can be created by showing slides in rapid succession. When using LaTeX beamer, this can be achieved by using the options \\animation. The minimum delay time for the frames, which have their duration set to zero, can be specified with
.BR \-m " or " \-\-min-delay .
.
.SS Slide transitions
.BR BeamerPresenter " supports slide transitions. Slide transitions can be disabled completely with the option " \-d " or " \-\-no-transitions .
.RB "For transitions of type \[dq]fly\[dq] which are not marked as rectangular, " BeamerPresenter " uses transparency effects which usually only look good for text flying in or out."
.
.SS Embedded applications
A link in the PDF pointing to an external application will usually be handled by the desktop services. But you can also specify programs, which will be executed directly when pressing the link.
.B BeamerPresenter
will try to embed the window created by the external program in the area of the link, by which it was created.
.PP
This requires that
.B BeamerPresenter
knows the window ID of this window. The simplest way of getting the window ID is by using an external application (e.g. a shell script using wmctrl), which tells you the window ID for a given process ID. The path so such an application can be provided by the argument to
.BR \-w " or " \-\-pid2wid
or by the corresponding default value in the configuration file. If no such application is specified,
.B BeamerPresenter
will try to read the window ID from the first line of the standard output of the external program.
Embedded applications can be disabled at compile time.
.
.SS Beamer option "show notes on second screen"
Beamer can combine notes and presentation into one PDF file by using the option "show slides on second screen". The resulting PDF file can be read by
.B BeamerPresenter
with the option
.BR \-p ", or " \-\-page-part
.
.SS Draw in presentation
You can draw in the presentation. You can access pens with customized colors and other tools by using key bindings or buttons on the control screen. Besides simple drawing with pens and highlighters you can emphasize parts of a slide using a torch, a magnifier and a pointer. In drawing mode all tools are synchronized between control screen and presentation screen.
.PP
As an experimental new feature you can now save and load drawings to a binary file format.
This is done using the key actions
.BR "save drawings" and "load drawings" .
.
.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.
.RB "The documentation of the configuration file beamerpresenter.conf can be found in " beamerpresenter.conf (5).

Additionally to the global configuration you can specify a local configuration file, which contains settings in JSON format. The local configuration overrides the global configuration and can be overridden by command line arguments. Since this file is in JSON format, the syntax of groups of arguments has to be adapted.
.RI "E.g. instead of \[dq]" "timer/time = color1" " ...\[dq] you should write " "\[dq]timer\[dq]: {\[dq]time1\[dq]: \[dq]color1\[dq], \[dq]time2\[dq]: \[dq]color2\[dq]}," .
.RB "The local configuration file may additionally contain a map " "page times" ", which defines times at which you want to finish certain slides. It has the format " "slide number: time" " where " time " is in the format mm:ss. Here the slide numbers refer to page labels in the pdf, but may currently only take integer values."
