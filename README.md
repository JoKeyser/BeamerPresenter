# BeamerPresenter
This project aims at creating a simple pdf viewer, which shows one pdf file as a
presentation in full screen mode and another pdf file with notes for the slides
on a second screen.

BeamerPresenter is only tested with presentations and notes generated by LaTeX
beamer. In contrast to other presentation programs, which use the beamer option
`show notes on second screen`, this program can show note pages, which have a
different size and aspect ratio than the slides.
This can be useful for slides with aspect ratio 16:9 or even wider.

Support for presentations generated with the beamer option
`show notes on second screen` is also present, but the focus of this program
lies on showing two independent pdfs. My personal impression is that LaTeX
beamer sometimes behaves unexpectedly in this mode.


## Build
To build and use this project you need to have the Qt5 multimedia module and the
poppler Qt5 bindings installed.

Download an compile this project:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/stiglers-eponym/BeamerPresenter.git
cd BeamerPresenter
qmake && make
```


## Usage
```sh
beamerpresenter <presentation.pdf> <notes.pdf>
```
For more options and usage possibilities use `beamerpresenter --help`.


## Patching LaTeX beamer
The typical usage case requires notes with the same page number as the
presentation. Generating such notes in LaTeX beamer can be achieved by applying
the following patch:

```tex
\setbeameroption{show only notes}
\makeatletter
  %
  % Overwrite beamer's definition of \beamer@framenotesend, such that for each
  % page generated in the presentation, one page will be generated in the notes.
  %
  \def\beamer@framenotesend
  {% at end of slide
    \global\setbox\beamer@frameboxcopy
      =\hbox{\leaders\copy\beamer@framebox\hskip\wd\beamer@framebox}
    \beamer@setupnote%
    \ifbeamer@notesnormals%
    \else%
      \global\setbox\beamer@framebox=\box\voidb@x%
    \fi%
  }
\makeatother
```

Alternatively you can use beamer's option to combine presentation and notes:
```tex
\usepackage{pgfpages}
\setbeameroption{show notes on second screen=right}
```
In this case links on the notes pages might require some patches in LaTeX.
