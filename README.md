# BeamerPresenter
BeamerPresenter is a PDF viewer for presentations, which opens a presentation
screen and a control screen in two different windows. The control screen
optionally shows slides from a dedicated notes document instead of the slides
for the audience. Additional information on the control screen includes the
current time, a timer for the presentation, and previews of the next slides.

This branch is in an early stage of completely rewriting BeamerPresenter in a
modular, clean and flexible way. The result is not usable yet!
