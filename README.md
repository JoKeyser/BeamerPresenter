# BeamerPresenter
This project aims at creating a simple pdf viewer, which shows one pdf file as a
presentation in fullscreen mode and another pdf file with notes for the slides
on a second screen.

BeamerPresenter is only tested with presentations and notes generated by LaTeX
beamer. In contrast to other presentation programs, which use the beamer option
`show notes on second screen`, this program can show note pages, which have a
different size and aspect ratio than the slides.
This can be an improvement when using slides with aspect ratio 16:9 or even
wider.

If you want your notes to have the same size as your slides, you might want to
choose a different presentation software, which supports the beamer option
`show notes on second screen`.

## Build

## Patching LaTeX beamer
This presentation software requires notes with the same page number as the
presentation. Generating such notes in LaTeX beamer can be achieved by applying
the following patch:

```tex
\setbeameroption{show only notes}
\makeatletter
  %
  % Overwrite beamer's definition of \beamer@framenotesend, such that for each
  % page generated in the presentation, one page will be generated in the notes.
  %
  \def\beamer@framenotesend
  {% at end of slide
    \global\setbox\beamer@frameboxcopy
      =\hbox{\leaders\copy\beamer@framebox\hskip\wd\beamer@framebox}
    \beamer@setupnote%
    \ifbeamer@notesnormals%
    \else%
      \global\setbox\beamer@framebox=\box\voidb@x%
    \fi%
  }
\makeatother
```
