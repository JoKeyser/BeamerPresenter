<h1>BeamerPresenter</h1>

BeamerPresenter is highly customizable. But only a part of the configuration can be done using a graphical interface.
<ul>
    <li>Keyboard shortcuts: can be done using the graphical interface with some limitations.</li>
    <li>general settings: almost all settings can be done using the graphical interface. Some settings require a restart. Documented in <code>man 5 beamerpresenter.config</code>.</li>
    <li>user interface: cannot be configured using the graphical interface. Documented in <code>man 1 beamerpresenter-ui</code>.</li>
</ul>
